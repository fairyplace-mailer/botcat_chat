# TODO

## Stage 2 (v1.0)

- Add UI button: **Download PDF Chat_Name** (public/original PDF).
  - The button should point to: `GET ${STATIC_BASE_URL}/t/<chatName>/public/pdf`.
  - Stage 1 already generates the public/original PDF; Stage 2 only exposes it in UI.

## Later

- Stage 3 (v2.0): auth + sidebar/history + downloads.

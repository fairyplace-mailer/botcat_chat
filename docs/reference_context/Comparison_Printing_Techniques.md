Comparison of Printing Techniques

Digital Printing:
- Uses inkjet technology for detailed, vibrant patterns. - Works well for small runs and prototypes.
- Unlimited color options, high precision, but may fade faster than traditional
methods.

Sublimation Printing:
- Uses heat to transfer dye into synthetic fibers (polyester).
- Produces durable, vibrant, wash-resistant prints.
- Limited to polyester-based fabrics. Screen

Printing:
- Traditional method using stencils and layers of ink. - Very durable and vibrant results.
- Economical for large runs, less efficient for complex/multi-color patterns. Block 

Printing:
- Hand-carved blocks used for artisanal textile production. - Creates unique, handcrafted aesthetics.
- Limited scalability; mostly for boutique and artisanal use.

Heat Transfer (Vinyl/Film):
- Transfers pre-printed films onto fabric.
- Suitable for small orders and promotional items.
- Less breathable, not suitable for high-end fashion. Overall, FairyPlace™ primarily recommends digital printing and sublimation for custom, on-demand projects due to flexibility, scalability, and quality.

FairyPlace™ Design Process Guide

Step 1: Client describes their wishes (optionally shares website for hospitality projects). 

Step 2: FairyPlace™ designer prepares sketches and coordinates with the client.

Step 3: Client reviews and approves the design.

Step 4: Upon approval, FairyPlace™ sends a order link to the chosen POD partner platform (e.g., Spoonflower, Contrado, Printful).

Step 5: Client places the order and pays directly on the POD partner’s website.

Step 6: Production and logistics are fully handled by the POD partner. FairyPlace™ never receives payments or manages logistics.
